# MNIST
The MNIST dataset is a dataset of handwritten numbers. The MNIST dataset, sometimes referred to as the Modified National Standards and Technology Database, is a modified subset of the NIST dataset. Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher Burges officially introduced this dataset in 1998 by selecting and combining a part of NIST.

Each selected image from NIST was once centered in 20 x 20 pixel boxes in two steps and then these same boxes were again placed in 28 x 28 boxes. Also, in the second step, the number in the middle of each photo was calculated by calculating the center of gravity in the middle of the photo.
